Dear Sir or Madam,

The purpose of this letter is to introduce a company 'Aka-group' that is specialized in the search of employees for the summer season. We've been successful in finding skilled short-term employees (participants of the 'Work& Travel USA' international program) for companies all across the U.S.

This is the way we work:
   1. You provide the list of available summer positions along with the job requirements.
   2. We look through the database of candidates and opt for suitable employees. 
   3. You select the appropriate employees, fill in a simple Job Offer application and send it out to us.
   4. Then relax: you don't need to give a second thought!
As soon as we check Job Offer and send it out to US sponsor, he/she will contact you to confirm your wish to hire that particular employee.
That’s it. In summer you get a skilled, responsible, hard-working employee.


Why international students are eligible to work in the U.S.Legal aspects
   1. All employees are participants of 'Work and Travel USA' program.
   2. 'Work and Travel USA' program is an official US State Department program that allows students to work in the USA during summer period (usually 4 months).
   3. All participants get a J1 visa - a temporary work permit giving them an access to a range of employment opportunities including work in service sector.
   4. To get J-1 visa employees provide the following documents: DS-2019 form, SEVIS payment, Job Offer as well as copies of Workers Compensation and Business License (received from employer).
The documents are verified by Sponsors (organizations approved by US State Department).


Advantages:

   1. We carefully interview and choose employees who are mature, motivated, and possess a multitude of skills.So, you save time and money cooperating with Aka-Group: you no longer need to advertise for staff.
   2. Since all applicants are interviewed by us, you don’t waste time on unqualified and impropriate candidates.
   3. As a rule international students are more self-motivated, hard-working and responsible. They consider the chance of working in the U.S. as a great opportunity to improve their skills, to do their best for a company and are ready to work day and night.
   4. We charge nothing for our services from US companies.

We sincerely acknowledge your time and efforts for reading this letter.
In case you are interested please feel free to contact us to discuss your personnel seasonal needs.

Hi!
My name is Andrey and I am writing you in regard of cooperation opportunity related to seasonal hiring.

For now a lot of companies in the US are currently seeking professionals to fill a variety of seasonal summer 2015 positions. Of course some can't predict their hiring needs, but usually summer is not the slowest season and at least 1-2 employees are always helpful.

But during recruitment process some employers face the problems such as:
- lack of experience and professional skills of employees;
- unwillingness of employees to work hard and do their best to increase an income of a company;
- uncertainty about the dates of availability in the summer;
- spending really much time on interviews.

All the problems listed above are easily solved by collaboration with 'Aka-Group' company for free.
How is it possible? Let's consider the way we work:

	1. All the employees are participants of international 'Work and Travel USA' program. It means that all the employees are students which are motivated, hard-working, energetic and ready to work hard from dawn till dusk. And we have a database of these employees which is updated/created each year.
	2. You provide the list of openinings and requirements for them.
	3. Then we find appropriate employees within our database which fit requirements and provide resume,video resume and another additional information to you.
	4. Then if anyone fit a position, we just prepare all necessary documents and that's it.

As I know from the restaurant reviews at various websites, your restaurant is a nice, comfortable and inviting place. So, I am sure that all employees will be pleased and happy to work for you. Thereby I have pleasure in inviting your particular company to cooperate  with me in the way described above.

I am confident that both employees and you will be satisfied with such kind of collaboration.
In case you are interested or you have questions, please, do not hesitate to ask. I would greatly appreciate your cooperation on this matter.

To see the detailed information about our company and the way we work see a presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/103tRSKk9Av6HldKHrBeIar4NA06cEvUpcqXCsUI22bY/edit?usp=sharing

Yours faithfully,
